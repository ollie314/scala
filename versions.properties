# Scala version used for bootstrapping. (This has no impact on the

starr.version=2.12.0-RC1-1e81a09

# Set in the following way:
#  - After 2.x.0 is released, the binary version is 2.x.
#  - During milestones and RCs, modules are cross-built against the full version.
#    So the value is the full version (e.g. 2.12.0-M2).
# Also determines how modules are resolved. For example, it determines which
# partest artifact is being used for running the tests.
scala.binary.version=2.12.0-RC1

# external modules shipped with distribution, as specified by scala-library-all's pom

# TODO: We've embedded these sources in partest-extras for now.
